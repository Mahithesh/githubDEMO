Git basic commands
-> git status  
-> git init (for installization is this folder)
if u got red color files that represent that are not in staging state
-> git add <filename>  (add file to the staging area)
or -> git add .    (to add all non-ignored files in current directory into staging area)
After adding, you can see green color on filenames.
Now we have added our changes to staging area. We need to commit these changes.
-> git commit -m "Your message"
To view the history of commits:
-> git log or simply git l
For seeing the differences between two points in time(commits):
git config --global.user.email  "your_email@example.com"
git config  --global user.name  "Your Name"
-> git diff [first-commit]..[second-commit]
You can also use tags for comparing any point with a tagged version.
git ls-files
This command lists all the files in the repository indexed by git.
-> git rm  <file name> (delete the untracked file from working tree and remove it from the index
if itâ€™s currently tracked)
if u want to delete from staging area  as well then use :
-> git rm --cached <file name>
how to save modified  content of a file back into the repository?
-> git checkout -- [file path]
